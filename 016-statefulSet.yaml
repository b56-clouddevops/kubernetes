# What is stateful set ?

# Certainly! A **StatefulSet** in Kubernetes is a workload API object designed to manage **stateful applications**. Let's dive into three key points about StatefulSets:

# 1. **Stable Identity and Unique Network Identifiers**:
#    - Unlike Deployments, which are better suited for stateless workloads, StatefulSets provide a **stable identity** for each of their Pods. Each Pod maintains a **persistent identifier** across rescheduling, making it easier to match existing volumes to new Pods that replace any failed ones.
#    - StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require **unique network identifiers**. If your application needs stable DNS names or predictable network addresses, StatefulSets are the way to go.

# 2. **Persistent Storage**:
#    - StatefulSets are designed for stateful applications that need **persistent storage**. They ensure that each Pod has its own dedicated storage volume.
#    - When pods run as part of a StatefulSet, Kubernetes keeps state data in the **persistent storage volumes** associated with the StatefulSet, even if the pods shut down or are rescheduled.

# 3. **Ordered Deployment and Scaling**:
#    - StatefulSets provide **ordered, graceful deployment and scaling**. Pods are created and scaled in a predictable order, ensuring that dependencies are met.
#    - If your application requires specific deployment order or rolling updates, StatefulSets offer the necessary guarantees.

# Remember that StatefulSets are commonly used for databases, caching systems, and other stateful workloads where stable identity and persistent storage are critical. üöÄüîç

### Storage Class
# Certainly! Let's delve into **Kubernetes Storage Classes** and then I'll provide you with a sample manifest.

# 1. **Storage Classes**:
#    - A **StorageClass** in Kubernetes is an API object that allows administrators to describe the classes of storage they offer. These classes can map to different **quality-of-service levels**, backup policies, or other arbitrary policies determined by cluster administrators.
#    - Unlike Deployments, which are more suitable for stateless workloads, **StatefulSets**, which we discussed earlier, are designed for **stateful applications**. StatefulSets ensure stable identities for Pods and provide persistent storage.
#    - Each StorageClass contains essential fields like **provisioner**, **parameters**, and **reclaimPolicy**. These fields come into play when a **PersistentVolume** (PV) belonging to the class needs to be dynamically provisioned to satisfy a **PersistentVolumeClaim** (PVC).

# 2. **Sample StorageClass Manifest**:
#    Below is an example of a StorageClass manifest:

# ```yaml
# apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
# kind: StorageClass
# metadata:
#   name: low-latency
#   annotations:
#     storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "false"
# provisioner: csi-driver.example-vendor.example
# reclaimPolicy: Retain # Default value is Delete
# allowVolumeExpansion: true
# mountOptions:
#   - discard # This might enable UNMAP / TRIM at the block storage layer
# volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
# parameters:
#   guaranteedReadWriteLatency: "true" # Provider-specific
# ```

# In this example:
# - The **provisioner** specifies the storage driver (e.g., CSI driver).
# - **reclaimPolicy** determines whether to retain or delete the PV when released.
# - **allowVolumeExpansion** enables volume resizing.
# - **mountOptions** can include additional options like enabling UNMAP/TRIM.
# - **parameters** are provider-specific settings.

# 3. **Default StorageClass**:
#    You can mark a StorageClass as the default for your cluster. When a PVC doesn't specify a `storageClassName`, the default StorageClass is used. Note that having multiple default StorageClasses allows for seamless migration.

# Remember, StorageClasses play a crucial role in managing storage for your Kubernetes workloads! üöÄüì¶
